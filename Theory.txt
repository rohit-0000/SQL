MySQL Architecture :
> It works on Client Server Architecture.
> We have client(By default command line) and Server in My server.
> All the works and storage will be done in Server. i.e formation of table , database.
> We Cannot directly access server , we have to talk to client first.
> suppose some work is given to client , then client request server for that work and server have its own query engine which take query and return to client after executing.
> we have GUI(Graphical user interface) clients for dealing with large no of tables. i.e Workbench , phpMyAdmin , sqlyog ,etc.
> If we give host, port, username and password to any client then it will connect with server and can send request and take response.
> we have to manually install GUI client (by default we have command line client).
> In server we have databases and we can create databases with different name where we can store tables
